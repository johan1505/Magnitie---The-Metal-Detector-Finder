# Magnitie - The-Metal-Finder

## Introduction

Magnitie is a four-wheel robot capable of finding small size metal objects such as coins, clips, nails, keys, and many other metal objects that he can find hidden on the floor as he travels. Magnitie starts moving only in a straight direction when a button is pressed. If Magnitie finds a metal object on his way, he stops, send a sound signal with his buzzer, backs up for a small distance, and stops so that the user can pick up the metall object found. After stopping, Magnitie will wait for user commands. If magnitie is ever close to collide with an obstacle, he will stop so that the user can either remove the obstacle or change his direction. Also, Magnitie outputs a smiling face on his LCD screen after finding a metal object and a sad face if he gets stopped due to an obstacle.
